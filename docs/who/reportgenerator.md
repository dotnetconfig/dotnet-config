[![reportgenerator](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/dotnet-reportgenerator-globaltool.svg?color=royalblue&label=reportgenerator)](https://nuget.org/packages/dotnet-reportgenerator-globaltool)

[ReportGenerator](https://github.com/danielpalme/ReportGenerator) converts coverage reports generated by OpenCover, dotCover, Visual Studio, NCover, Cobertura, JaCoCo, Clover, gcov or lcov into human readable reports in various formats.

It provides a dotnet [global tool](https://www.nuget.org/packages/dotnet-reportgenerator-globaltool/) 
which supports `.netconfig` to configure the multitude of options that generating complex reports 
require, for example:

```gitconfig
[ReportGenerator]
	reports = coverage.xml
	targetdir = "C:\report"
	reporttypes = Latex;HtmlSummary
	assemblyfilters = +Test;-Test
	classfilters = +Test2;-Test2
```

All the plural options can also be specified as multiple singular entries, like:

```gitconfig
[ReportGenerator]
	report = coverage1.xml
	report = coverage2.xml
	reporttype = Latex
	reporttype = HtmlSummary
	assemblyfilter = +Test
	assemblyfilter = -Test
	classfilter = +Test2
	classfilter = -Test2
	filefilter = +cs
	filefilter = -vb
	sourcedir = src
	sourcedir = test
```
